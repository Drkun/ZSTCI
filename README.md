# ZSTCI
 Incremental Embedding Learning via Zero-Shot Translation,AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (__AAAI__), 2021.
 
 __Requirments__
 
All training and test are done in Pytorch framework.

Pytorch vesion: 0.4.1

Python version: 3.6

__Datasets__

We evaluate our methods in CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100. (Note: CUB-200-2011 do not split the train set and test set in the original folder, the splited datasets can be download from this [link](ttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sjJTCbVriYSbntQfGMQUJH7y2D_UogT2) according to the original provided train/test text file.)

__Train and test__

__run CUB:__

bash  run_demo_cub.sh

__run Cifar100:__

bash  run_demo_cifar.sh
